# Cancer Prediction

Using only two features; namely, the mean radius of the tumor (radius_mean) and its mean number of concave points (concave points_mean), predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign:
* Using Decision Trees, comparing entropy and gini as criteria
* Using a voting classifier (logistic regression, decision trees and KNN)

Using all the features, predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign:
* Using adaBoost and Bagging

Using all the features, predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign:
* Using GridSearch to tune the hyperparameters of the Decesion Tree
